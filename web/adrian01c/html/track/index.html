    <h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Did Romania melt the Russian tanks with a laser in 1968?</h1>
    <h2 style="color: brown;">As the story goes, in November of 1968, Soviet forces were massing on Romania’s eastern border, in preparation for a military intervention. This was a reprisal prompted by Ceausescu’s defiant stance, particularly with regard to the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia earlier that year. That is when, supposedly, a top secret super powerful laser sprung into action, melting/vaporizing several tanks and aircraft, scaring the Soviets shitless and dissuading them from their belligerent intentions.</h2>

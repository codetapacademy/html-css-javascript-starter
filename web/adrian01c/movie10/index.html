    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bb/Donnie_brasco_ver2.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>The film is loosely based on the true story of Pistone (Johny Depp), an FBI undercover agent who infiltrated the Bonanno crime family in New York City during the 1970s, under the alias Donnie Brasco. Brasco maneuvers his way into the confidence of an aging Mafia hitman, Lefty Ruggiero (Pacino), who vouches for him. As Donnie moves deeper into the Mafia, he realizes that not only is he crossing the line between federal agent and criminal, but also leading his friend Lefty to an almost certain death.</h2>

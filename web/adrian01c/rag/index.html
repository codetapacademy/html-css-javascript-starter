    <h1>The Graphics Interchange Format (GIF; /ɡɪf/ GHIF or /dʒɪf/ JIF) is a bitmap image format that was developed by a team at the online services provider CompuServe led by American computer scientist Steve Wilhite on 15 June 1987.[1] It has since come into widespread usage on the World Wide Web due to its wide support and portability between applications and operating systems.</h1>
    <h2>The format supports up to 8 bits per pixel for each image, allowing a single image to reference its own palette of up to 256 different colors chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space. It also supports animations and allows a separate palette of up to 256 colors for each frame. These palette limitations make GIF less suitable for reproducing color photographs and other images with color gradients, but well-suited for simpler images such as graphics or logos with solid areas of color.</h2>

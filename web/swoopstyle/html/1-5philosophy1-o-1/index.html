    <h1 style="font-size: 25px">Plato (c. 427– c. 347 B.C.)</h1>
    
    <p>
      The dialogue form in which Plato writes is more than a mere literary
      device; it is instead an expression of Plato’s understanding of the
      purpose and nature of philosophy. For Plato, philosophy is a process of
      constant questioning, and questioning necessarily takes the form of
      dialogue. Near the end of the Phaedrus, Socrates expresses his
      reservations about written texts, worrying that people will cease to think
      for themselves when they have someone else’s thoughts written out in front
      of them. Plato took it upon himself to write his thoughts down anyway, but
      he was careful not to write them in such a way that we could easily
      assimilate his thoughts rather than thinking for ourselves. Many of the
      dialogues reach no definite conclusions, and those that do generally
      approach those conclusions by casting doubts and examining possible
      counterarguments. Plato cannot be there in person to share his thoughts
      with us, but he wants to ensure that we think through them ourselves.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In keeping with this emphasis on dialogue form, Plato develops an
      increasingly complex conception of dialectic, or logical argument, as the
      engine that drives philosophical investigations. In the early dialogues,
      dialectic consists of Socrates cross-examining and refuting his
      interlocutors until he brings them to a state of perplexity, or aporia.
      Beginning with the Meno, Plato recognizes that dialectic can lead people
      not only to recognize their errors but also to positive discoveries, as
      Socrates does with the slave boy in the Meno. Plato is sufficiently
      impressed with the possibilities of the dialectic that, in the Republic,
      he makes it the highest achievement of his rigorous education program. The
      Phaedrus introduces a more systematic version of the dialectic, seeing it
      as a matter of “division and generalization,” whereby we analyze concepts
      so as to understand the precise relations between them. This process of
      division and generalization becomes increasingly sophisticated throughout
      Plato’s works, and we witness advanced versions of it in the Parmenides
      and the Sophist.

    <h2>Rene Descartes: Cogito, ergo sum, latin: “I think, therefore I am"</h2>
    <!-- 3 HTML Display  -->
    <p>
      Descartes was the first of the modern rationalists and has been dubbed the
      'Father of Modern Philosophy.' Much subsequent Western philosophy is a
      response to his writings, which are studied closely to this day. Descartes
      thought that only knowledge of eternal truths – including the truths of
      mathematics, and the epistemological and metaphysical foundations of the
      sciences – could be attained by reason alone; other knowledge, the
      knowledge of physics, required experience of the world, aided by the
      scientific method. He also argued that although dreams appear as real as
      sense experience, these dreams cannot provide persons with knowledge.
      Also, since conscious sense experience can be the cause of illusions, then
      sense experience itself can be doubtable. As a result, Descartes deduced
      that a rational pursuit of truth should doubt every belief about sensory
      reality. He elaborated these beliefs in such works as Discourse on the
      Method, Meditations on First Philosophy, and Principles of Philosophy.
      Descartes developed a method to attain truths according to which nothing
      that cannot be recognised by the intellect (or reason) can be classified
      as knowledge. These truths are gained "without any sensory experience,"
      according to Descartes. Truths that are attained by reason are broken down
      into elements that intuition can grasp, which, through a purely deductive
      process, will result in clear truths about reality.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Descartes therefore argued, as a result of his method, that reason alone
      determined knowledge, and that this could be done independently of the
      senses. For instance, his famous dictum, cogito ergo sum or "I think,
      therefore I am", is a conclusion reached a priori i.e., prior to any kind
      of experience on the matter. The simple meaning is that doubting one's
      existence, in and of itself, proves that an "I" exists to do the thinking.
      In other words, doubting one's own doubting is absurd. This was, for
      Descartes, an irrefutable principle upon which to ground all forms of
      other knowledge. Descartes posited a metaphysical dualism, distinguishing
      between the substances of the human body ("res extensa") and the mind or
      soul ("res cogitans"). This crucial distinction would be left unresolved
      and lead to what is known as the mind-body problem, since the two
      substances in the Cartesian system are independent of each other and
      irreducible.

    <h2>
      Immanuel Kant - "Happiness is not an ideal of reason, but of imagination."
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kant is one of the central figures of modern philosophy, and set the terms
      by which all subsequent thinkers have had to grapple. He argued that human
      perception structures natural laws, and that reason is the source of
      morality. His thought continues to hold a major influence in contemporary
      thought, especially in fields such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics,
      political philosophy, and aesthetics.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Kant named his brand of epistemology "Transcendental Idealism", and he
      first laid out these views in his famous work The Critique of Pure Reason.
      In it he argued that there were fundamental problems with both rationalist
      and empiricist dogma. To the rationalists he argued, broadly, that pure
      reason is flawed when it goes beyond its limits and claims to know those
      things that are necessarily beyond the realm of every possible experience:
      the existence of God, free will, and the immortality of the human soul.
      Kant referred to these objects as "The Thing in Itself" and goes on to
      argue that their status as objects beyond all possible experience by
      definition means we cannot know them. To the empiricist he argued that
      while it is correct that experience is fundamentally necessary for human
      knowledge, reason is necessary for processing that experience into
      coherent thought. He therefore concludes that both reason and experience
      are necessary for human knowledge. In the same way, Kant also argued that
      it was wrong to regard thought as mere analysis. "In Kant's views, a
      priori concepts do exist, but if they are to lead to the amplification of
      knowledge, they must be brought into relation with empirical data

    <h2>Cicero: Defence Speeches</h2>
    <p>
      The writings of Marcus Tullius Cicero constitute one of the most famous
      bodies of historical and philosophical work in all of classical antiquity.
      Cicero, a Roman statesman, lawyer, political theorist, philosopher, and
      Roman constitutionalist, lived in 106–43 BC. He was a Roman senator and
      consul (chief-magistrate) who played a critical role in the transformation
      of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. A contemporary of famous
      Roman politicians such as Julius Caesar and Pompey, Cicero is widely
      considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Cicero is generally held to be one of the most versatile minds of ancient
      Rome. He introduced the Romans to the chief schools of Greek philosophy
      and created a Latin philosophical vocabulary, distinguishing himself as a
      linguist, translator, and philosopher. An impressive orator and successful
      lawyer, Cicero probably thought his political career was his most
      important achievement. Today, he is appreciated primarily for his humanism
      and philosophical and political writings. His voluminous correspondence,
      much of it addressed to his friend Atticus, has been especially
      influential, introducing the art of refined letter writing to European
      culture. Cornelius Nepos, the 1st-century BC biographer of Atticus,
      remarked that Cicero's letters to Atticus contained such a wealth of
      detail "concerning the inclinations of leading men, the faults of the
      generals, and the revolutions in the government" that their reader had
      little need for a history of the period.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      During the chaotic latter half of the first century BC, marked by civil
      wars and the dictatorship of Gaius Julius Caesar, Cicero championed a
      return to the traditional republican government. However, his career as a
      statesman was marked by inconsistencies and a tendency to shift his
      position in response to changes in the political climate. His indecision
      may be attributed to his sensitive and impressionable personality; he was
      prone to overreaction in the face of political and private change. "Would
      that he had been able to endure prosperity with greater self-control and
      adversity with more fortitude!" wrote C. Asinius Pollio, a contemporary
      Roman statesman and historian.

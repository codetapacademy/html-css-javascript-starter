      <h1 style="border:2px solid Tomato;">William Shakespeare - All the world is a stage</em></h1>  
      <em>
        All the world's a stage,
        And all the men and women merely players;
        They have their exits and their entrances,
        And one man in his time plays many parts,
        His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
        Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
        Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
        And shining morning face, creeping like snail
        Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
        Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
        Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
        Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
        Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
        Seeking the bubble reputation
        <br>
        Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
        In fair round belly with good capon lined,
        With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
        Full of wise saws and modern instances;
        And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
        Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
        With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
        His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
        For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
        Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
        And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
        That ends this strange eventful history,
        Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
        Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

    <h1 style="border:2px solid blue;">Hafiz - School of truth</em></h1>  
    <em>
      O fool, do something, so you won't just stand there looking dumb.
      If you are not traveling and on the road, how can you call yourself a guide?
      <br>
      In the School of Truth, one sits at the feet of the Master of Love.
      So listen, son, so that one day you may be an old father, too!
      All this eating and sleeping has made you ignorant and fat;
      By denying yourself food and sleep, you may still have a chance.
      Know this: If God should shine His lovelight on your heart,
      I promise you'll shine brighter than a dozen suns.
      <br>
      And I say: wash the tarnished copper of your life from your hands;
      To be Love's alchemist, you should be working with gold.
      Don't sit there thinking; go out and immerse yourself in God's sea.
      Having only one hair wet with water will not put knowledge in that head.
      For those who see only God, their vision
      Is pure, and not a doubt remains.
      <br>
      Even if our world is turned upside down and blown over by the wind,
      If you are doubtless, you won't lose a thing.
      O Hafiz, if it is union with the Beloved that you seek,
      Be the dust at the Wise One's door, and speak!
      <br>

   <h2 style="border:2px solid green;">Rumi - Let go of your worries</em></h2>  
   <em>
    Let go of your worries and be completely clear-hearted,
    like the face of a mirror that contains no images.
    If you want a clear mirror, behold yourself
    and see the shameless truth, which the mirror reflects.
    If metal can be polished to a mirror-like finish,
    what polishing might the mirror of the heart require?
    Between the mirror and the heart is this single difference:
    the heart conceals secrets, while the mirror does not.

   <h3 style="border:2px solid purple;">Dic Jones - Priodas</h3>  
   <em>
    Dwy galon, un dyhead,
    Dwy dafod ond un iaith,
    Dwy raff yn cydioâ€™n ddolen,
    Dau enaid ond un daith.
   
   (Two hearts, one wish,
   two tongues but one language,
   two ropes that join connected,
   two souls but one journey)

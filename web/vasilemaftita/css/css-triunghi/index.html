    <h1>
      CSS is capable of making all sorts of shapes. Squares and rectangles are
      easy, as they are the natural shapes of the web. Add a width and height
      and you have the exact size rectangle you need. Add border-radius and you
      can round that shape, and enough of it you can turn those rectangles into
      circles and ovals.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      We also get the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements in CSS, which give us
      the potential of two more shapes we can add to the original element. By
      getting clever with positioning, transforming, and many other tricks, we
      can make lots of shapes in CSS with only a single HTML element.

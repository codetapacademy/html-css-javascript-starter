      Yeah, I know… I’m probably starting with the most obvious of Greek

      With its clifftop villages and amazing views, it’s one of the unique Greek
      Islands that has been massively shaped by a volcanic eruption a few
      thousand years ago. Legend has it that the island is actually the home of
      Atlantis which was devoured by the sea quite a few millennia ago.

      10 Best Things To Do In Mykonos, Greece
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: rgb(255, 165, 0)">
      Perched within the turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea, Mykonos is one of
      Greece’s most famous little islands. North of the stunning island of
      Santorini, it’s an island that<strong>is incredible to visit.</strong>
      That being said, it can be tough (at times) to actually narrow down some
      of the best things to do in Mykonos, especially when there is so much to
      see. One of the things I love about Mykonos is that it’s tiny, it’s so
      small that it can easily be explored in a day or two (though, a few days
      longer is a must if you really want to experience island life).<strong>
        It’s the kind of Greek island you visit which has a perfect mix of
        charm, culture and beautiful views.
      </strong>
      This is why I wanted to share some of the best things to do in Mykonos. It
      doesn’t matter if it’s your first, fiftieth or gazillionth time on the
      island, I’m almost certain you’ll have the best time.
    </p>
    <p class="two">
      I’ve also included a few details on travelling around the island, where to
      eat and places to stay. Hopefully, these should all help you on your trip
      to find the best things to do in Mykonos. It really is a special little
      island.<strong> = Travelling around Mykonos =</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="one">
      As I’ve been banging on about, Mykonos is a relatively small island but
      there are still plenty of ways you can get around the island that doesn’t
      involve hiring a donkey (unless you want to, obviously). Moped: It’s
      pretty easy to hire a moped on Mykonos, especially with the correct
      license and a sensible driver. The best thing to remember is to always
      wear a helmet and drive the roads with a respectable amount of caution.
      There are lots of twists, turns, lumps and bumps that can easily surprise
      a new driver. If you’re not 100% sure about riding one, go for a taxi or
      bus instead.
    </p>
    <p class="ex3">
      Bus: There are buses that scurry around the island, with the frequency
      being a little higher in the summer months. There is a bus terminal just
      off the yacht docking area (see the map, here) in Mykonos town. kaiki: A
      Kaiki is a small boat that you can actually get to key points of the
      island, which is great to get to places like Platis Yialos Beach. You can
      also grab a Kaiki to head over to Delos Island and pick your tickets up at
      the port in Mykonos harbour itself. These tend to be a little pricey but
      great if you want to experience something a little different. = What to
      eat in Mykonos =
    </p>
    <div>
      Greek food… where do I start? Greek food is the best. I’ve yet to find one
      Greek meal I don’t like (unless it contains mushrooms, yuck!). Anywho,
      there’s a whole heap of delicious meals you have to gorge on whilst on the
      island, just make sure to take elasticated trousers and an empty tummy! 🤣
      For a great island eatery, head over to Popolo for a tasty little lunch
      (try their Greek coffee, too).<strong>
        Also, if you’re looking for something a little fancier, M-eating creates
        some of the islands most delicious fine dining plates. Make sure to try
        their sea bass, it’s so yummy. Oh, and if you’re driving around the
        island, pop into Kiki’s Tavern on the north coast.</strong
      >
      It’s a relaxed and authentic little grill that has views over the sea.
      It’s so blissful and probably one of the best meals we had in Mykonos.
      Loved it. Make sure to try some yummy, amygdala when you get to the
      island. Their sweet, crushed almonds that are too delicious to avoid. If
      you’re looking to try a range of authentic Greek cuisine, take a look at
      our post here that details some of the most hunger-inducing meals you’ll
      want to devour. Where to sleep in Mykonos

      The great thing about Mykonos is that there are lots of little, intimate
      and cosy places to rest your head. For a cool, little hotel head over to
      the Mykonos Princess (which we loved). We stayed here for six days and
      it’s only around 10-minutes (in a taxi) from Mykonos Town. If you’re
      looking to keep costs lower, consider getting your own white-washed,
      stone, Airbnb apartment on the island which is especially good if you’re
      wanting to stay somewhere unique. Best things to do in Mykonos

      = 4.) Crete = Crete is, without a doubt, the largest of the beautiful
      islands in Greece you should visit. The best thing about Crete is that
      there’s so much to see, meaning you can easily justify a week or two just
      on the island itself. Heck, go for a month if you want!
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst you’re exploring the island, head over to Spinalonga Island to see
      the historic fort, take a boat to the isolated Greek village of Loutro and
      ramble around Balos Lagoon. You’ll get some epic views. = Read more on
